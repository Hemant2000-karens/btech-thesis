% Abstract

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}

    In an era dominated by digital connectivity, the persistent threat of ransomware looms large, posing a formidable challenge to the security of individuals and organizations alike. Ransomware, a malicious software that encrypts or locks files and demands a ransom for their release, has evolved into a sophisticated and dynamic cyber threat. Understanding the nuances of ransomware is pivotal in developing effective countermeasures to safeguard against its pernicious impacts.

    Ransomware, at its core, is a form of cyber extortion wherein malicious actors leverage advanced encryption algorithms to restrict access to files or entire systems. The victim, often left with no recourse, is coerced into paying a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, to obtain the decryption key. This nefarious practice has given rise to various types of ransomware, each exhibiting distinct characteristics and complexities.
    
    {\fontspec{EBGaramond-MediumItalic}Encrypting Ransomware:} This variant employs robust encryption algorithms, rendering files inaccessible until a ransom is paid. Notable examples include CryptoLocker and WannaCry.

    {\fontspec{EBGaramond-MediumItalic}Locker Ransomware:} Instead of encrypting files, locker ransomware locks users out of their systems, demanding payment for access restoration. Instances like the FBI virus and Winlocker fall into this category.

    {\fontspec{EBGaramond-MediumItalic}Scareware:} While not encrypting files, scareware falsely claims the presence of malware, tricking users into paying for non-existent security solutions.

    {\fontspec{EBGaramond-MediumItalic}Mobile Ransomware:} Targeting mobile devices, this variant demands payment for decrypting files or unlocking the device. Svpeng and Android Defender are prominent examples.
    
    {\fontspec{EBGaramond-MediumITalic}Doxware/Leakware:} This type of ransomware not only encrypts files but also threatens to release sensitive information to the public if the ransom is not paid. It adds a layer of extortion by leveraging the fear of data exposure.
    
    Ransomware works in several stages, first stage is infection in this ransomware typically gain the access to a system through phishing emails containing malicious attachments, compromised websites and exploiting vulnerabilities in software. Once executed it starts its malicious activities.Second stage is encryption, One common type of ransomware encrypts the victim's files using strong encryption algorithms. This renders the files inaccessible without the decryption key, which only the attacker possesses. After encrypting the files, the ransomware displays a ransom note informing the victim of the encryption and demanding payment, often in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Monero. The note typically includes instructions on how to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key. If the victim decides to pay the ransom, they follow the instructions provided in the ransom note to transfer the cryptocurrency to the attacker's wallet. However, there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in the decryption key being provided, and it may even encourage further attacks. In some cases, victims receive a decryption key after paying the ransom, allowing them to regain access to their files. However, there have been instances where the decryption key provided was faulty or the attacker disappeared after receiving payment, leaving the victim without recourse.
    
    Ransomware attacks can have severe consequences, including financial losses, data breaches, and disruption of operations for businesses and individuals.

% Methodology
\section{Methodology}

In the fight against ransomware, a comprehensive approach involving various detection techniques is essential. The following sections detail the methodologies employed, each with its strengths and weaknesses.

We are trying to implement Ransomware Detection with differently approach, that no one might though about. In our detection Approach, we can develop some kind of algorithm and tactics which can scan, ransomware, and not only ransomware, but any kinds of malicious sect of code/ file, which can leads to execution of ransomware. 

Incorporating a combination of these techniques provides a layered defense against ransomware, enhancing the likelihood of early detection and mitigation.

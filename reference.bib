abstract = {Modern day ransomware families implement sophisticated encryption and propagation schemes, thus limiting chances to recover the data almost to zero. We investigate the use of software-defined networking (SDN) to detect and mitigate advanced ransomware threat. We present our ransomware analysis results and our developed SDN-based security framework. For the proof of concept, the infamous WannaCry ransomware was used. Based on the obtained results, we design an SDN detection and mitigation framework and develop a solution based on OpenFlow. The developed solution detects suspicious activities through network traffic monitoring and blocks infected hosts by adding flow table entries into OpenFlow switches in a real-time manner. Finally, our experiments with multiple samples of WannaCry show that the developed mechanism in all cases is able to promptly detect the infected machines and prevent WannaCry from spreading.}

abstract = {Ransomware is currently one of the key threats facing individuals and corporate Internet users. Especially dangerous is crypto ransomware that encrypts important user data, and it is only possible to recover it once a ransom has been paid. Therefore, devising efficient and effective countermeasures is a pressing necessity. In this paper we present a novel Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based detection approach that utilizes the characteristics of the ransomware communication. Based on an observation of network communication between two crypto ransomware families, namely CryptoWall and Locky, we conclude that an analysis of the HTTP message sequences and their respective content sizes is enough to detect such threats. We show the feasibility of our approach by designing and evaluating a proof-of-concept SDN-based detection system. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient.}

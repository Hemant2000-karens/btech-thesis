abstract = {Modern day ransomware families implement sophisticated encryption and propagation schemes, thus limiting chances to recover the data almost to zero. We investigate the use of software-defined networking (SDN) to detect and mitigate advanced ransomware threat. We present our ransomware analysis results and our developed SDN-based security framework. For the proof of concept, the infamous WannaCry ransomware was used. Based on the obtained results, we design an SDN detection and mitigation framework and develop a solution based on OpenFlow. The developed solution detects suspicious activities through network traffic monitoring and blocks infected hosts by adding flow table entries into OpenFlow switches in a real-time manner. Finally, our experiments with multiple samples of WannaCry show that the developed mechanism in all cases is able to promptly detect the infected machines and prevent WannaCry from spreading.}

abstract = {Ransomware is currently one of the key threats facing individuals and corporate Internet users. Especially dangerous is crypto ransomware that encrypts important user data, and it is only possible to recover it once a ransom has been paid. Therefore, devising efficient and effective countermeasures is a pressing necessity. In this paper we present a novel Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based detection approach that utilizes the characteristics of the ransomware communication. Based on an observation of network communication between two crypto ransomware families, namely CryptoWall and Locky, we conclude that an analysis of the HTTP message sequences and their respective content sizes is enough to detect such threats. We show the feasibility of our approach by designing and evaluating a proof-of-concept SDN-based detection system. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient.}

abstract = {The ransomware threat has loomed over our digital life since 1989. Criminals use this type of cyber attack to lock or encrypt victims' data, often coercing them to pay exorbitant amounts in ransom. The damage ransomware causes ranges from monetary losses paid for ransom at best to endangering human lives. Cryptographic ransomware, where attackers encrypt the victim's data, stands as the predominant ransomware variant. The primary characteristics of these attacks have remained the same since the first ransomware attack. For this reason, we consider this a key factor differentiating ransomware from other cyber attacks, making it vital in tackling the threat of cryptographic ransomware. This paper proposes a cyber kill chain that describes the modern crypto-ransomware attack. The survey focuses on the Encryption phase as described in our proposed cyber kill chain and its detection techniques. We identify three main methods used in detecting encryption-related activities by ransomware, namely API and System calls, I/O monitoring, and file system activities monitoring. Machine learning (ML) is a tool used in all three identified methodologies, and some of the issues within the ML domain related to this survey are also covered as part of their respective methodologies. The survey of selected proposals is conducted through the prism of those three methodologies, showcasing the importance of detecting ransomware during pre-encryption and encryption activities and the windows of opportunity to do so. We also examine commercial crypto-ransomware protection and detection offerings and show the gap between academic research and commercial applications.}
